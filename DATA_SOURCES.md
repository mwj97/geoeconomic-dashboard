## Temporal Considerations

### 2024 Disruptions
- **Suez Canal/Red Sea**: 50% reduction due to Houthi attacks (December 2023 onwards)
- **Panama Canal**: Drought-related transit restrictions reducing capacity

### Normal Year Estimates
For non-disrupted conditions, add ~$500B to Suez Canal value (~$1,200B total).
